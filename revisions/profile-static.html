				<h3>MAR ROXAS</h3>

				<iframe width="640" height="440" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyeO01ZYvuU?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

				<p>Manuel "Mar" Araneta Roxas II (born May 13, 1957) is a Filipino politician who serves in the Cabinet of the Philippines as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government since 2012. Previously, he was the Secretary of Trade and Industry from 2000 to 2003, a Senator from 2004 to 2010, and Secretary of Transportation and Communications from 2011 to 2012. He is the son of former Senator Gerry Roxas, and the grandson of former Philippine President Manuel Roxas and of industrialist J. Amado Araneta.</p>

				<p>A graduate of the Wharton School, Roxas worked as an investment banker, mobilizing venture capital funds for small and medium enterprises.[1] He served as the Representative of the 1st District of Capiz from 1993 to 2000. His stint as Congressman was cut short after he was appointed by President Joseph Estrada as Secretary of Trade and Industry.[2] He resigned from the position at the height of the EDSA Revolution of 2001 and was later re-appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in her new Cabinet.[3] He resigned again to run for a Senate seat in the 2004 Philippine election.[4] He was elected as Senator with 19 million votes and the highest ever garnered by a national candidate in any Philippine election. He was co-author of the Expanded Value Added Tax Law (E-Vat).[5]</p>

				<p>Initially one of the leading contenders in the 2010 presidential election, he slid down to become a vice-presidential candidate in order to make way for fellow Senator Benigno Aquino III. He was defeated by Makati City Mayor Jejomar Binay of the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) by the narrowest margin in the history of the Fifth Republic. However, Roxas filed an electoral protest with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, the Court sitting as Presidential Electoral Tribunal.[6]</p>

				<p>On June 7, 2011, President Benigno Aquino III appointed Roxas as the new Secretary of Transportation and Communications to replace outgoing Secretary Jose de Jesus, and he took office on July 4, 2011.[7] Afterwards, on August 31, 2012, President Aquino nominated him as Secretary of Interior and Local Government, replacing Jesse Robredo, who died in a plane crash.</p>

				<p>Roxas is set to be the nominee of the Liberal Party in the 2016 presidential elections. On July 31, 2015, at an event dubbed as "A Gathering of Friends", Roxas formally accepted his party's nomination after he was officially endorsed by President Benigno Aquino III in the presence of their political allies at the Club Filipino, where Roxas had announced his decision to withdraw from the 2010 presidential election and give way to Aquino's presidential bid. Aquino also announced his candidacy there on 9 September 2009.[8][9][10] On the same day, Roxas formally launched his campaign website.</p>

				<p>On August 3, 2015, Roxas officially tendered his resignation as Secretary of the Interior and Local Government in order to focus on his presidential campaign</p>

				<h3>Early life and career</h3>

				<p>Roxas was born on May 13, 1957, in Manila, Philippines to Judy Araneta of Bago City, Negros Occidental and Gerardo Roxas (1924–1982) of Capiz. Roxas' father was a Senator (1963–1972) and the only son of Manuel Roxas, the first President of the Third Philippine Republic, and Trinidad de Leon. The couple married in 1955.[12] He has two siblings namely Maria Lourdes or Ria, married to Augusto Ojeda and mother of three and the late Congressman Gerardo "Dinggoy" Roxas, Jr. (1960–1993).[13]</p>

				<p>Roxas attended Ateneo de Manila University for grade school and high school, then attended the Wharton School of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, earning a degree in economics in 1979.</p>

				<p>After graduation, he worked for seven years as an investment banker in New York, and became an assistant vice president of the New York-based Allen & Company. Following the 1985 announcement by President Ferdinand Marcos of a snap election, he took a leave of absence to join the presidential campaign of Corazon Aquino.</p>

				<p>In September 1986, President Corazon Aquino went to the United States. He was one of those who organized a series of investment round-table discussions with the American business community. From 1986 onwards, he visited the Philippines more frequently.</p>

				<p>He then proposed to his company to set up shop in Asia, specifically in the Philippines, and later his superiors agreed. In 1991, he was stationed in the country under North Star Capitals, Inc. which took Jollibee public. In the United States, he participated in the first financing of Discovery Channel and Tri-Star Pictures.</p>
